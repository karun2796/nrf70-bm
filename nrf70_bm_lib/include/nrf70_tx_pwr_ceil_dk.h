 * @brief nRF7002 DK TX power ceiling configuration.
 *
 * The configuration applies to the nRF7002 DK board targets, as well as
 * to board targets for nRF7001 and nRF7000 IC variants emulated on the
 * nRF7002 DK.
 *
 * The following macros are normally auto-generated from DeviceTree
 * when building the nRF70 driver in a Zephyr environment. They are
 * copied here as standard preprocessor directives for ease of porting.
 *
 * The values are represented in 0.25 dB increments.The values for the
 * other MCS rates are interpolated from the values for MCS0 and MCS7.
