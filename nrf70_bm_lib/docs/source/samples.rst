Samples
#######

The nRF70 BM repo provides samples that specifically target Nordic Semiconductor devices and show how to implement typical use cases with Nordic Semiconductor libraries and drivers.
Samples showcase a single feature or library.
These samples are a good starting point for understanding how to put together your own application.

The following samples are available:

Scan
++++

The Scan sample demonstrates how to use the Nordic Semiconductor's Wi-Fi® chipset to scan for the access points without using the wpa_supplicant.

Radio test
++++++++++

The Radio test sample demonstrates how to use the Nordic Semiconductor's Wi-Fi® chipset to test the radio functionality.
